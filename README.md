# A Fullstack TypeScript React Apollo example

The client and the server should be run separately.

Start by ensuring both have the necessary packages installed to run the application.
Go inside each folder and run:

<code>npm install</code>

Then to run the server, go inside the server folder and run:

<code>npm run dev</code>

In another terminal go inside the client folder and run:

<code>npm run start</code>

This should install the necessary packages, build and compile the typescript code to javascript and then have NodeJS run our builed server project and have react-scripts run our builed client project.
